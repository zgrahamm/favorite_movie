<p>After Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) dies in a car accident, he is guided through the afterlife by his spirit guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). <br> His new world is beautiful and can be whatever Chris imagines. Even his children are there. <br> But, when his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra), commits suicide and is sent to hell, Chris ignores Albert's warnings and journeys there to save her. <br> Upon arrival, Chris finds that rescuing Annie will be more difficult than he'd imagined.</p>
